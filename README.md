# Dice Drafting

Tableau building through dice drafting

The <xyz> entry for my 2019 Boardgame Prototype Challenge (https://gist.github.com/andreasfrisch/74fc8bc0fe5b34672c1f5d8dae21f3e7)

## What you need

* A printout of the tableau tiles in this repository.
* A printout of the player boards in this repository.
* Around 15 cubes in the colours pink, orange, and teal.
* 4 dice in each colour orange, pink, teal
* A single white dice. 

## Setup

* Give each player a player board
* Sort the tableau tiles by level (6 for each level) and arrange them next to the game board.
* Reveal 3 of each level of tableau tile
* Randomly determine a starting player

## Start of the round
The current start player will gather all the dice for the round and roll them within reach of all players.
The dice used are indicated on the player tableaus.
Besides the dice indicated for each player, add the white dice too.

## Taking a turn
Starting with the first player, and continuing around the table in clockwise order, each player will select a die from the pool.
This continues until no more dice are left in the pool, at which time the round will end.

When selecting a die immediately place it on your tableau to activate one of the action spaces there.
Each action space requires either a specific colour of die, a specific range of pips, or a combination.

If you cannot place a die legally, you cannot take a die and must instead pass your turn.
If all players have to pass on the remaining, the round will also end.

Some tableau tiles add additional dice to the dice pool, which means that not all players receive the same amount of dice each round.

## End of the game
The game will end when 2 of the three tableau tile stacks are exhausted.

## Scoring
Score is calculated as follows:

* Each player receives the points printed on tableau tiles they own
* Each player receives the points printed on their player board
* Each cube left in a players possession is worth 1/2 point
* The current start player receives 1 points
